# CollabFuse

**CollabFuse** is a privacy-first SocialFi platform that connects emerging startups with up-and-coming influencers through secure, trustless collaboration tools powered by zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and smart contracts.

## üöÄ Vision

In today's creator economy, early-stage startups and micro-influencers struggle to find secure, mutually beneficial ways to collaborate. CollabFuse bridges this gap with:

- Swipe-based matching with anonymized profiles
- Privacy-preserving identity and reputation verification via ZKPs
- Enforceable smart contracts for secure campaign execution
- A trustless, decentralized ecosystem for scalable influencer marketing

## üß† Technical Overview

- **Frontend**: Mobile-first UI/UX with swipeable cards (Flutter/React Native)
- **Backend**: Node.js / Rust with cloud-based infrastructure
- **ZK Integration**: Zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure and reputation scoring, using [Aleo](https://www.aleo.org/)
- **Smart Contracts**: Confidential, enforceable agreements built on Aleo‚Äôs private smart contract platform
- **Privacy & Security**: Full GDPR/CCPA compliance, end-to-end encrypted communications

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Planned)
- Aleo SDK / Leo language
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for minimal metadata storage
- IPFS (optional) for encrypted file storage
- OAuth + custom verification layers

## üìÖ Roadmap
- [ ] MVP architecture + onboarding flow
- [ ] Aleo ZKP prototype: follower count proof demo
- [ ] Smart contract template for influencer-brand agreement
- [ ] Reputation system using ZK-verified metrics
- [ ] Beta testing & feedback loop
